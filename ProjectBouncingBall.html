          <h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4>
        </br>
          <h5>In this project, I was instructed to create a bouncing ball game that allows the ball to keep on bouncing as it hits the wall. 

    </h5>
          <br>
          <h4><b>REFLECTION</b></h4>
        </br></h4>
          <h5>This project was a fun way to reminisce about my childhood games and be able to code it, however, I was not able to fully master the requirements of completing the game due to errors within the code structure and technical errors. I enjoyed using the fun color scheme to match the season, however, the function of this game was improper as it did not fully work. </h5>
